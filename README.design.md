Design tokens and responsive notes

- Tokens live in `app/design-tokens.css`.
- Split layouts collapse to a single column at 980px and reduce overlap at 640px.
- Accent blocks use `.accent-block` and `.overlap`. On mobile, overlaps reduce and padding shrinks.
- To adjust global spacing, edit `--space-*` in `design-tokens.css`.
